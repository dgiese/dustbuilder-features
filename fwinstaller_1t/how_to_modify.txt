This firmware has two hooks, which are checked when the robot is booted:

/data/_root.sh  -> If this file exists, it will be executed after partitions have been mounted (but before the network comes up)
/data/_root_postboot.sh -> If this file exists, it will be executed after the system booted (via rc.local)
